Product Requirements Document: "25 Days" Anniversary App
Project Overview
Project: A personalized web application serving as a 25-day countdown calendar to celebrate a 6-month anniversary.

Objective: To create a daily surprise for my girlfriend, counting down from 25 to 1. Each day unlocks a new, custom-designed page with memories, starting from our anniversary (July 20th) until we meet again.

Developed By: vibe coding (AI Agent)

1. User Personas
Administrator (Me): The sole content manager. My goal is to design a unique, rich content layout for each of the 25 days before the countdown begins.

Recipient (My Girlfriend): The only end-user. Her goal is to visit the app daily to unlock a new day in the countdown and revisit previous ones.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Recipient-Facing Application (React Frontend)
Home Screen:

Display a grid of 25 cards, numerically labeled in descending order from 25 down to 1.

Countdown Logic:

The countdown begins on July 20, 2025, with card "25" unlocking. The final card, "1", will unlock on August 13, 2025.

A new card unlocks automatically each day at 05:00 AM GMT-4. The backend API must enforce this timing.

Cards for future dates must appear "locked" and be unclickable.

Memory View:

Clicking an unlocked card navigates to a dedicated page for that day.

This page must render the rich HTML content exactly as designed by the Administrator.

2.2 Administrator Panel & Functionality
Authentication & Access:

A secure route (e.g., /admin) for content management, protected by a single password.

Admin Password: vibeCoding2025!

Admin Preview Mode:

The administrator must be able to preview any day's content—even locked days—to ensure it looks correct.

This is achieved by appending a query parameter to the URL (e.g., /day/15?preview_token=vibeCoding2025!). The backend must validate this token to serve the content.

Content Management (Rich Text WYSIWYG Editor):

The admin interface must provide a powerful, interactive, "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) editor for each of the 25 days, similar to a word processor.

Editing Capabilities: The editor must give the administrator full control over the content's appearance, including:

Text Formatting: Font families, font sizes, colors, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough.

Layout: Text alignment (left, center, right), lists (bulleted, numbered).

Media Embedding: Ability to upload and insert images, GIFs, videos, and audio files directly into the content flow at any position.

Saving the day's layout will send the complete, raw HTML of the content to the backend API for storage.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
Design & Styling:

The overall aesthetic should be romantic, personal, and summery.

Utilize Tailwind CSS to create a beautiful, modern, and fully responsive user interface.

The color palette should be based on light yellow, warm orange, and soft pink.

Security & Time Synchronization:

The backend must strictly enforce the 05:00 AM GMT-4 unlock time for the recipient. Any attempt to access content from a locked day without the admin preview token must be rejected.

The backend server should synchronize with a global NTP server to ensure time accuracy.

4. Technical Specifications
Backend: FastAPI (Python) API.

Frontend: React Single-Page Application (SPA).

Database: PostgreSQL.

Storage: AWS S3 Bucket for all media assets.

Infrastructure: The entire application (React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL) must be containerized and managed via a single Docker Compose file.

5. Data Model (PostgreSQL)
Instruction for AI Agent: The choice of tables and schema is delegated to you. The data model must support the application's requirements. Key considerations:

It must store 25 unique entries, one for each day of the countdown.

Each entry must store its countdown label (25 down to 1).

Each entry must have a specific release_datetime_utc (DATETIME or TIMESTAMP) to enforce the time-lock.

Each entry must be able to store a large block of raw HTML generated by the WYSIWYG editor.

6. Key Dates & Timeline
Countdown Start (Day 25 unlocks): July 20, 2025

Countdown End (Day 1 unlocks): August 13, 2025
